# Pareto Diagram
The Pareto Chart consists of two pieces. A bar chart showing the absolute frequency of returns by category and a line chart showing the proportional cumulative frequency of returns. 

## Data Source
The file used for this exercise has been provided by the professor and is called: Superstore-2021.xls

## Bar Chart
First, let us look at creating the bar chart. Before plotting, some data preparation is necessary.

```

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = FALSE)
```
